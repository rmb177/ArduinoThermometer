ArduinoThermometer
==================

A digital thermometer that processes temperature readings
from an Arduino.

The schematic for the Arduino is from the SparkFun Inventor's
Kit for Arduino: 
   http://www.sparkfun.com/products/10173

The schematic datasheet along with the code can be found here:

The SerialMonitor code was adapted from the sample source
code in the Arduino Playground found here:
   http://www.arduino.cc/playground/Interfacing/Java

The RXTX jar and jni lib files were downloaded from the
following site:
   http://jlog.org/rxtx-mac.html

To run the application, wire up the schematic, connect the Arduino
to your Mac and run the build.sh script.
